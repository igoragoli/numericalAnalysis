# numericalAnalysis

In this repository there are some programs that I built to help me during the numerical analysis course at my university.

### JacobiAndGSMethodsMatrix.m
A simple implementation of Jacobi's and Gauss-Seidel methods with matrices.

### dividedDifferences.m
 Generates a divided differences table for polynomial interpolation.

### forwardDifferences.m
Generates a forward differences table for polynomial interpolation.
